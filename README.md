# Advent of Code 2023 in Python

When each next puzzle comes out, I'll publish my solve for the last day here!  
I'm using python, so a note:

> [!NOTE]
> my solution requires the use of the requests library, so after installing a recent version of python (needs to be 3.7+ I think), you're going to need to do
> `pip install requests`  
> that should be it though, and should work out of the box otherwise!
